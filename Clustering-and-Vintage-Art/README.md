# Vintage Picture Generator
    “Art is the journey of a free soul.” -- Alev Oguz

## :art: Introduction
Art is everywhere in life. In my mind, photography is a form of art. I have a great interest in image post-processing because I think as I drastically change the outcome of the image captured by a camera, I’m manipulating it to fit my artistic expression. There are many ways of post-processing, the most common tool is Adobe Photoshop, and the easiest way is to apply a filter. We can make the photo look retro, have a color tint, or apply some other kind of effect. I am a huge fan of vintage styles, but simply adjusting some parameters or using some filters sometimes does not give me the vintage effect I’m looking for.

I wanted my version of vintage pictures to have a simple color scheme, and look a bit surreal and 2D. How can I get such transformations? This is how I came up with the K-means clustering algorithm. To get a better idea of how it works, I first implemented it from scratch. I also investigated its limitations by comparing it with another clustering algorithm called Spectral clustering. In the end, I applied the K-means algorithm to conduct vintage image transformations.

  * K-means clustering from scratch
  * Spectral clustering from scratch
  * Compare my implementions with the built in sklearn kmeans functions
  * Compare two clustering algorithms 
  * Discuss the efficacy of the work via time
  * An artistic application of k-means
