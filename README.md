Hi, there! I'm Helena, an aspiring Software Engineer with an interest in Data Science. 

I'm passionate about using data to gain beautiful insights, make better decisions, and help machines learn. This GitHub repo is a collection of my machine-learning-related projects for academic, self-learning, and hobby. The idea is to concisely demonstrate that I have a sufficient understanding of fundamental machine learning algorithms to be able to implement, differentiate, build, evaluate, and use them. Beyond machine learning, I'm interested in full-stack development. Besides Python, I also have experience coding in R, SQL, Javascript, and Java. I enjoy developing both frontend and backend portions of an application.

Each coding element is in its subdirectory with 1)a readme file as a formal writeup, 2)Jupiter notebook(s) that walks through the code, 3)unit tests, and other related data files.
